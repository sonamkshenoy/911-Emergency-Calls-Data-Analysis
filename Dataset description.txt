Many of the cities in Pennsylvania were boroughs that sought recognition as cities as they grew bigger. Today, a borough with at least 10,000 people can ask to become a city by putting the question to its voters. Boroughs are defined, incorporated political subdivisions, but they tend to be smaller than cities. Most of the 959 boroughs in Pennsylvania, for example, have populations under 5,000, though there are exceptions. Boroughs follow a Borough Code. Townships are, generally, even smaller than boroughs, though there’s a lot of variation with that, as well. Pennsylvania’s 1,546 townships are separated into two classifications; by default a township is a second class township, but if it has at least 300 people per square mile it can offer residents the chance to vote the township into first class status.  There is just one incorporated town in Pennsylvania, Bloomsburg.   

A borough is a self-governing entity that is generally smaller than a city. If an area is not governed by either a borough or city, then the area is governed as a township. Villages or hamlets are unincorporated and have no municipal government, other than the township in which they are found. County governments serve a larger geographical area than cities and towns, but a smaller area than states.
